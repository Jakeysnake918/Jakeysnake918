Yo, what up- name's Jacob Wolfe. I'm from Illinois and been making stupid-ass projects since elementary (most pre 2021 will not be on here).
I mainly only know how to code in Microsoft Batch, so if something of mine is in a different language, it's most likely either AI-generated or a joint effort with one of my more code-inclined friends.
I love music with a burning passion (It's my life) and specialize in PCB design and decent 3D modelling in Inventor 2025 (funded by my high school, of course).
Don't expect much from me, because there's probably nothing worthwhile coming out of me.
